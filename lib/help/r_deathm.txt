#####GDescription
Death Molds are incredibly powerful creatures. However, they are also 
molds. Lacking the ability to move as other creatures do, Death Molds have
the powers of Phase Door, targeted teleportation, telekinesis, and 
controlled Teleport Level. They also intrinsically resist Nexus and Nether,
and are more skilled at Necromancy than other races.
